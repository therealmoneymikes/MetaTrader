Building DLLs with python

If you prefer to use python to build DLLs with python 
which in some case I do prefer follow the instructions

To see the example of pybind11 in action see the eaexamples/pricegraphea.mq4 file


1. Install pybind11 (I use this manily) but you can use ctypes
    Follow the link for info ctypes, this a more light weight package,
    which is better than pybind11 for legacy C++ codebases or for older compilers

    Install via pip for pybind11: pip install pybind11
    Install pybind11 with cmake integrate: pip install pybind11[cmake]
