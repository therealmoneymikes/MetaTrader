# DLL Integration for MQL4 and MQL5 with Python and C++

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository showcases how to integrate **DLLs** into **MQL4** and **MQL5** environments using **Python** and **C++**. It provides simplified examples and guides to help you:

- Build **DLL files** using C++.
- Utilize **pybind11** to create Python-based DLLs for MQL4/MQL5, eliminating the need for advanced C++ knowledge.
- Integrate database engines with Expert Advisors (EAs).
- Develop secure and efficient DLL APIs for:
  - Authentication  
  - Data retrieval  
  - Enhanced trading functionality
- Expand your skills in building robust trading bots.

### 1. Fork and Clone
- **Fork** this repository to create your version.  
- Clone the repository to your local environment:  
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
  ```

### 2. Build the DLL
- Configure the provided **CMake** file for your target DLL.  
  *(Videos and detailed guides coming soon!)*  
- Leverage tools like **pybind11** or your IDE for building the DLL files.

### 3. Python Logic in EAs
- Implement Python-based analytical logic (e.g., using `matplotlib`) for use within MetaTrader.  
- Use the provided templates to structure your Python logic effectively.

### 4. Compile the DLL
- Build the target DLL file in the **C++ folder** using the provided CMake configuration.  
- Rename the `.pyd` (Windows) or `.so` (Mac/Linux) file to `.dll` if necessary.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### For Python Enthusiasts:
1. Install **pybind11**:  
   ```bash
   pip install pybind11
   ```
2. Write or modify the Python code to suit your needs.  
3. Use **pybind11** to build the DLL.

### For C++ Developers:
1. Modify the provided **C++ code** to suit your requirements.  
2. Compile the code using:
   - **Direct compilation**
   - **CMake** (recommended)

### DLL Integration with MQL4/MQL5:
1. Copy your compiled DLL to:  
   ```
   MetaTrader > MQL4/MQL5 > Libraries
   ```
2. Import the DLL in your Expert Advisor, indicator, or script:  
   ```mql
   #import "YourLibrary.dll"
   // Define your DLL functions here
   #import
   ```
3. Call the DLL functions in your MQL code.
